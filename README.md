# EIP-712 Verifiable Credentials

## Slightly modified version of https://github.com/ra-phael/eip712-vc ðŸ™Œ

This is a simple example of how Verifiable Credentials can be verified on-chain.

It is based on the [EIP-712 standard for typed structured data hashing and signing ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and [Ethereum EIP712 Signature 2021](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ethereum-eip712-signature-2021-spec/).

The VC used is very basic and minimal, more properties such as id could be added. The basis for this example VC ("DaoVc") is defined in `mocks > exampleDocument.json`. The credential subject is simply:

```json
"credentialSubject": {
    id: string;
    iamHash: string;
    provider: string;
  }
```

On chain verification of

### Pre Requisites

Before running any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic or a private key as an environment
variable. Follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, use this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

Then run

```
npx hardhat present
```

First, this will deploy the smart contracts locally and generate a serialized Verifiable Credential, which is signed by the private key provided as environment variable and looks like this:

```

  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:pkh:eip155:1:0xe4c81FCb008E04C9bc5AD607f0cb14E4AC07896d",

### Some remarks

- The proof object is based on [Ethereum EIP712 Signature 2021](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ethereum-eip712-signature-2021-spec/).
- "@" is not a valid character in a variable name in Solidity, hence why the `@context` and `@type` properties are renamed `_context` and `_type` respectively.
- The `did:pkh` method is used which allows us to turn the Ethereum address of the VC issuer / signer into a valid DID. The inverse of this "process" is done on-chain by the pseudo-resolver in `DIDpkhAdapter.sol`.

<br/>

Then, the content of the whole VC (minus the proof object) and the signature attached to it is verified on-chain against the Ethereum address in `issuer`. This is done by calling `verifyDaoVc()`. If the verification is successful you should see:

```
Verification passed on-chain?  true
Gas cost:  83550
```

As shown above, the verification consumes 83,550 gas.
The following table gives an estimate of the cost in dollars on Ethereum Mainnet, based on different gas prices:

| Gas price (gwei) | Cost ($) |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| 5                | $0.66    |
| 10               | $1.32    |
| 20               | $2.64    |
| 30               | $3.96    |

<br/>

## Next steps

- [ ] Create an example of a VC as voucher that can be redeemed against something such as ERC20 tokens or 721 tokens
- [ ] Generalize the implementation so that an on-chain VC verifier is not tightly coupled to a specific VC schema
